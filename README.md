## Author
This documentation is written by Samuel Daigle, a Senior Unreal Engine Network and System Engineer with diverse experience in the game industry.

Having spent years solving real-world problems in both AAA and indie games, this cheat sheet has been my personal reference throughout my career. It is everything I wish I had when I started: concise, practical and constantly evolving. Now, I’m sharing it to help you build better games, faster.

This work was made possible thanks to countless uncredited sources, including community discussions, technical articles, YouTube deep dives and AI tools like ChatGPT, all of which have shaped my understanding over the years.
