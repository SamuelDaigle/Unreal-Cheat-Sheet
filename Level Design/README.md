# Level Design
Contains advices on level design.

## Iterate quickly and frequently
Avoid wasting precious time on a level section that may get deleted or heavily modified.
1. Start from a rough greyboxing layout using basic shapes. The goal is to get the right sizing, travel time and general feeling.
2. Experiment with landmarks and layouts that make the level unique.
3. Playtest with gameplay and adjust level accordingly.
4. Slowly convert large grey boxes into actual mesh with materials.
5. Add progressively more detailed meshes, foliage, VFX and details.

## Use procedural generation
When creating a larger world, it is best to procedurally general the base layout of the level, then manually add landmarks to make the game mode unique.
