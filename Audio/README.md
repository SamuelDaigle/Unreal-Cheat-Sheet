# Audio
**3D sound (UE4/UE5)** : 
Use AmbientSound with spatialization to enable 3d sound based on distance. Use .wav files with 16-bit, then right-click and Create Cue.

**Audio Mixer (UE4)** : 
Processes Submix Graphs onto the Master Submix, which can be created to have audio buses.

**MetaSoundSource (UE5)** : 
Use the WavePlayer with different left and right outputs. Possible to apply process nodes (stereo delay, bitcrusher, etc) to each output and to mix two sounds with a StereoMixer node.

**AudioBusWriter (UE5)** : 
Use inside the MetaSoundSource.
